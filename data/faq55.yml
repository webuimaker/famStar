    answer: "Famstar is open to all brands, New to the market, local brands, established brands, everyone, whoever wants to do influencer marketing, including PR, Media, Advertising or Creative Agencies."
  - question: "Is Famstar a global platform?"
    answer: "Famstar is open to all brands whose presence is in India and sells their product/s to Indian customers, irrespective of where it is located. It can be a local brand or a global brand. But Famstar would work only for Indian influencers since we are currently launching in India only."
  - question: "Who generates the content?"
    answer: "Brands submit their campaign briefs and the content creators create the posts accordingly.. Brands can be represented by their agencies but only the influencers construct their posts."
  - question: "Who owns the content?"
    answer: "The influencer owns the content, as it's been generated by them with a financial contribution from a brand to be featured within it. Therefore a brand can share an influencer's post within the platform it appears, but cannot use the content for any advertising outside of that. Remember to share the post within the 30 days it's active."
  - question: "What's the approval process?"
    answer: "Once the brand submits the campaign brief, influencers either create and submit a post or can even submit a sample content to the brand on the basis of which the brand can shortlist the influencer. If a brand approves it, the influencer can then publish it on their social media and collect the before-mentioned payment."
  - question: "How long is an influencer required to keep their post live?"
    answer: "Influencers are supposed to keep it for 30 days & after that, they can remove the post but most leave it on their feed as they would any other."

  - question: "How can I be sure I'm not paying to reach fake followers?"
    answer: "A brand needs to look through the engagement of influencers who make offers. Accounts with fake followers are easy to determine as their profile has no interaction and are filled with spam. If we identify an influencer with fake followers, we'll remove them from our platform."
  - question: "When does payment get charged?"
    answer: "Famstar charges a fee for all campaigns sent live on the Famstar platform. Then, you only pay for the content you approve. "
  - question: "Can I browse influencers before I post a campaign?"
    answer: "Choosing influencers is like trying to target individual buyers on Amazon. Instead, Famstar is a true marketplace, designed for modern requirements. To build such an extensive pool of influencers, we've also taken on board their preference to browse campaigns anonymously. The moment they submit a post to your campaign, we provide all the information you may require. Click through to their social profiles and assess their suitability."
  - question: "Is there a minimum spend?"

The exception to this rule is when a product is yet to launch or inaccessible to an influencer. In this case, we'll arrange for you to send them your samples."
  - question: "How do I get product samples to the influencer?"
    answer: "We don't even encourage sending product samples for influencers to post about or using the barter system for availing their services.

  - question: "Is a post guaranteed to reach all the influencer's fans?"

    answer: "For now, we do not have this feature but soon, we will add it to our kitty. "
  - question: "What if I don't like the posts being submitted?"
    answer: "Influencers have developed a certain connection with their thousands of personal interactions. From bad grammar to amateurish photography, the value of a post is measured by audience interaction and the influencer's credibility. However, it still doesn't mean the post is a right fit for your brand, thus choose thoughtfully."
  - question: "How do I choose an influencer?"
    answer: "Do your research! Study influencer's tone of voice, engagement, value-delivered and brand-fit, among other things."
  - question: "What if I'm unhappy with the final results?"
    answer: "We can't control certain variables within social media that we can't control. Contact us at hello@famstar.in and we'll walk you through any posts submitted for your campaign to help you get the best ROI."
  - question: "How do I know if this influencer is worth their fee?"
    answer: "Measuring the value of a post may come down to the creativity of the content, the familiarity of the influencer, the size and engagement of their tribe, and how well they fit your brand. However, we should tell you that it's totally subjective and may vary from person to person. "
  - question: "What if the influencer publishes the incorrect post?"
    answer: "Whereas these things shouldn't happen but still this occurs, please contact us at hello@famstar.in and we'll rectify the situation. "
  - question: "Why is no one submitting posts for my campaign?"

    answer: "You can also track your campaign’s performance with real-time analytics, and you can also measure its success with a downloadable report of your best content, campaign metrics & industry benchmarks."

  - question: "How much should I charge?"
    answer: "Based on our research, we've designed a rate within the Famstar app. We,  however, recommend you start low and only raise it if you feel you can. Having said that is obvious that the higher your fee, the stronger your recognition, content and audience engagement should be."
  - question: "How can I apply for campaigns?"
    answer: "Easy! Download the Famstar app, register with your email address or Instagram account, create your profile, explore campaigns and submit your posts. Content creators can also save posts which brands can later explore, select for their campaigns and pay the money for the same."
  - question: "How do I get the brand's products?"
    answer: "Brands won't send you a product through Famstar unless the product is yet to be released. We believe and expect our influencers to promote products you already love or are willing to try. If you aren't prepared to buy a product, how can you recommend it to your FAM?"
  - question: "What happens if I've purchased the product but had my post declined?"
    answer: "It's unpleasant, but purchasing a product without getting paid to recommend it is no different than any other purchase made by you outside of Famstar."

    answer: "No, not at all. We work very closely with talent agencies to offer solutions so they can manage all of their client's campaigns in the one location. Ask us how at hello@famstar.in."
  - question: "Are brands allowed to negotiate my asking price?"
    answer: "Famstar is a marketplace like any other, therefore, it is only natural that they do."
  - question: "Once approved, how long do I have to post?"
    answer: "You should within 48 Hours unless directed otherwise. "
  - question: "Where is my money?"
    answer: "Once the approved post is published, we'll transfer you the agreed-upon amount into your nominated bank account within 48 hours (or 30 days, depending on the payment option you select)."
  - question: "Why is no one accepting my offers?"
    answer: "Be patient. Often brands like to see a number of submissions before they accept any or all of them. You may also want to re-submit with a lower offer, as high rates can discourage brands."
  - question: "Is there such a thing as too many sponsored posts?"
    answer: "Yes. Famstar regularly features brands in our social posts, paid or not. If you're taking more than you can give, you'll lose influence. Only you can determine how often you should post but we urge you to be conservative, and if in doubt, we're here to offer one-to-one guidance."
  - question: "Will I receive backlash for many sponsored posts?"
    answer: "If you create organic and entertaining content, your audience is likely to respond positively. You invest energy into your audience, you deserve to be rewarded. Having said that, you will face negativity from time to time."

  - question: "What is a Content Farm?"
    answer: "Content Fam is a content library that allows content creators to do what they love - CREATE QUALITY CONTENT. Influencers can create content, save it in the library and get paid once the brand selects your post/content piece. "
  - question: "How can I be a part of Content Farm?"
